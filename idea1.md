My first idea is eating a sushi roll. 
1. the plate is full with sushi rolls
2. the sushi rolls get eaten one by one and the viewer sees chopsticks grabbing the suhsi rolls
3. the sushi rolls disappear one by one
4. the plate is empty 
The sushi rolls will change every time as they get eaten, with 4 variations of sushi roll flavors. 
The sound will be the eating noises after a piece of sushi is eaten, and also a bell sound when the plate is empty.
The mouse has to hover over the rolls and click for them to be eaten.
