My second idea is cleaning a window
1. the window is dirty and black, so the outside cannot be seen
2. the window is being sprayed with cleaning product
3. the window is being wiped
4. the window is now clean and the eoutside world can be seen
the mouse can click anywhere on the window to spray it, and when it is sprayed fully a towel will appear to start wiping it.
Once it is clean, the world outside will move, like the sun rays or clouds. I will use spray noises and squeeky cleaning noises.
